Project Scope:
•	Design and build a working model of a retractable landing gear for a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or model aircraft.
•	Focus on the mechanical design and operation of the landing gear, including the retraction mechanism, shock absorption, and structural integrity.
•	Consider the weight and size constraints of the UAV or model aircraft.
•	Document the entire design and build process, including CAD models, calculations, and assembly instructions.
Design Considerations:
•	Retraction Mechanism: 
o	Choose a suitable mechanism for retracting the landing gear, such as a lever, gear linkage, or hydraulic actuator.
o	Ensure smooth and reliable operation of the retraction mechanism.
o	Consider the forces and torques involved in retracting the landing gear.
•	Shock Absorption: 
o	Design a shock absorption system to protect the UAV or aircraft during landing.
o	Use springs, dampers, or a combination of both to absorb the impact forces.
o	Consider the weight and size of the shock absorption system.
•	Structural Integrity: 
o	Design the landing gear to withstand the loads during takeoff and landing.
o	Use materials that are strong and lightweight, such as aluminum or carbon fiber.
o	Consider the fatigue life of the landing gear components.
•	Weight and Size: 
o	Minimize the weight and size of the landing gear to reduce the overall weight and drag of the UAV or aircraft.
o	Optimize the design for minimal weight and size while maintaining structural integrity.
Materials and Tools:
•	Aluminum or carbon fiber for the main structure
•	Steel or other suitable materials for the retraction mechanism and shock absorption components
•	Bearings and other mechanical components
•	CAD software for design and modeling
•	3D printer or CNC machine for prototyping and manufacturing
•	Basic workshop tools for assembly and testing
Testing and Evaluation:
•	Test the landing gear for functionality and performance.
•	Verify the retraction and extension mechanisms, shock absorption, and structural integrity.
•	Perform ground tests to simulate takeoff and landing loads.
•	Consider flight testing the UAV or aircraft with the retractable landing gear to evaluate its performance in real-world conditions.
Additional Considerations:
•	Safety: Ensure the landing gear is safe to operate and does not pose any hazards.
•	Reliability: Design the landing gear for reliable operation in various conditions.
•	Maintainability: Make the landing gear easy to maintain and repair.
•	Cost: Consider the cost of materials and manufacturing when designing the landing gear.
